# Edit $PS1 variable

`PS1` is set in your `~/.bashrc`. This file contains settings which will be applied in every `interactive shell`. An interactive bash shell is what you get when you open a terminal in Linux/Mac, unless you have set a different default shell for your user, such as `ZSH`

In an interactive shell, we need a prompt, and it's nice if the prompt gives us some useful info, like the current working directory, the current user and the hostname, as the `PS1` does.



```bash title="Add this to `~/.bashrc` file"
PS1="$ "
```

The source the file using

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
